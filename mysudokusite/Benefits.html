<br/>
</p>Sudoku is a “Brain Game” </p>
<ul>
<li>Sudoku might help people reduce their risk of Alzheimer’s disease </li>
<li>Sudoku promotes logic, deduction and problem solving </li>
<li>Sudoku helps people reconnect with different parts of their brain that 
they might not always get to utilize in everyday life</li> 
<li>It also helps us get better at spotting patterns, filling in gaps, and recognizing opportunities.<br/> 
All of these mental abilities are very important to continue to utilize throughout our lives. <br/> 
As the old saying goes, “Use it or lose it!”</li>
<li>Sudoku creates a sense of order and accomplishment</li>
<li>It reflects and reinforces the feeling of creating order and getting things done</li>
</ul>

<!-- I added bullet points, changed background color of my bullet point texts, and added spaces-->

<ul>
   <li>Sudoku may seem very challenging at first, but after understanding the fundamental concepts it all makes sense</li>

      <li>stimulate the brain</li>
      <li>challenge friends</li>
      <li>take focus off of stressful situations</li>
   </ol>
</ul>
